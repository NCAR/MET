**Foreword: A note to MET users**

This User's guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation Tools (MET).  MET is a set of verification tools developed by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather prediction community to help them assess and evaluate the performance of numerical weather predictions.

It is important to note here that MET is an evolving software package.  Previous releases of MET have occurred each year since 2008. This documentation describes the 9.1 release from MONTH YYYY.  Intermediate releases may include bug fixes.  MET is also able to accept new modules contributed by the community. If you have code you would like to contribute, we will gladly consider your contribution.  Please send an email to:  `met_help@ucar.edu <mailto:>`__.  We will then determine the maturity of new verification method and coordinate the inclusion of the new module in a future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of the MET, including Tressa Fowler, John Halley Gotway, Randy Bullock, Kathryn Newman, Julie Prestopnik, Lisa Goodrich, Tara Jensen, Barbara Brown, Howard Soh, Tatiana Burek, Minna Win-Gildenmeister, George McCabe, David Fillmore, Paul Prestopnik, Eric Gilleland, Nancy Rehak, Paul Oldenburg, Anne Holmes, Lacey Holland, David Ahijevych and Bonny Strong.

**Acknowledgments**

We thank the the National Science Foundation (NSF) along with three organizations within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): 1) Office of Atmospheric Research (OAR); 2) Next Generation Global Prediction System project (NGGPS); and 3) United State Weather Research Program (USWRP), the United States Air Force (USAF), and the United States Department of Energy (DOE) for their support of this work.  Funding for the development of MET-TC is from the NOAA's Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) through the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).  Funding for the expansion of capability to address many methods pertinent to global and climate simulations was provided by NOAA's Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) and NSF Earth System Model 2 (EaSM2) projects.   We would like to thank James Franklin at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for his insight into the original development of the existing NHC verification software.  Thanks also go to the staff at the Developmental Testbed Center for their help, advice, and many types of support.  We released METv1.0 in January 2008 and would not have made a decade of cutting-edge verification support without those who participated in the original MET planning workshops and the now dis-banded verification advisory group (Mike Baldwin, Matthew Sittel, Elizabeth Ebert, Geoff DiMego, Chris Davis, and Jason Knievel).
