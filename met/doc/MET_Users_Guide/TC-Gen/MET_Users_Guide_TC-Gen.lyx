The TC-Gen tool provides verification of tropical cyclone genesis forecasts
 in ATCF file format.
 Producing reliable tropical cyclone genesis forecasts is an important metric
 for global numerical weather prediction models.
 This tool ingests deterministic model output post-processed by a genesis
 tracking software (e.g.
 GFDL vortex tracker) and ATCF format reference dataset(s) (e.g.
 Best Track analysis and CARQ operational tracks) and outputs categorical
 counts and statistics.
 The capability to modify the spatial and temporal tolerances that define
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 forecast is included to give users the ability to condition the criteria
 based on model performance and/or conduct sensitivity analyses.
 Statistical aspects are outlines in Section 21.2 and practical aspects of
 the TC-Gen tool are described in Section 21.3.

\begin_layout Section
Statistical aspects
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:TC-Gen-Statistical-aspects"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The TC-Gen tool populates a contingency table with hits, misses, and false
 alarms.
 As with other extreme events (where the event occurs much less frequently
 than the non-event), the correct negative category is not computed the
 non-events would dominate the contingency table.
 Therefore, only statistics that do not include correct negatives should
 be considered for this tool.
 The following CTS statistics are relevant: Base rate (BASER), Mean forecast
 (FMEAN), Frequency Bias (FBIAS), Probability of Detection (PODY), False
 Alarm Ratio (FAR), Critical Success Index (CSI), Gilbert Skill Score (GSS),
 Extreme Dependency Score (EDS), Symmetric Extreme Dependency Score (SEDS),
 Bias Adjusted Gilbert Skill Score (BAGSS).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other considerations for interpreting the output of the TC-Gen tool involve
 the size of the contingency table output.
 The size of the contingency table will change depending on the number of
 matches.
 Additionally, the number of misses is based on the forecast duration and
 interval (specified in the configuration file).
 This change is due to the number of model opportunities to forecast the
 event, which is determined by the specified duration/interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Care should be taken when interpreting the statistics for filtered data.
 In some cases, variables (e.g.
 storm name) are only available in either the forecast or reference datasets,
 rather than both.
 When filtering on a field that is only present in one dataset, the contingency
 table counts will be impacted.
 Similarly, the initialization field only impacts the model forecast data.
 If the valid time (which will impact the reference dataset) isn't also
 specified, the forecasts will be filtered and matched such that the number
 of misses will erroneously increase.
 See section 1.3.2 for more detail.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
This section describes how to configure and run the TC-Gen tool.
 The TC-Gen tool identifies tropical cyclone genesis events in both genesis
 forecasts and ATCF track datasets.
 It applies configurable logic to process the forecast and observed genesis
 events, classify them, and populate a contingency table with hits, misses,
 and false alarms.
 It writes the categorical counts and statistics to the output file(s).
 The tool can be configured to apply one or more sets of filtering criteria
 in a single run.
 The following sections describe the usage statement, required arguments,
 and optional arguments for

Required arguments for tc_gen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
1.
 The 
\series bold
-genesis path
\series default
 
\series medium
argument specifies an ATCF forecast genesis file or top-level directory
 containing them, with files matching the regular expression 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

atcf_gen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The 
\series bold

 option must be used at least once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
2.
 The 
\series bold
-track path
\series default
 
\series medium
argument specifies an ATCF track file or top-level directory containing
 them, with files ending in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.dat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This tool processes both BEST track data from bdeck files and operational
 track data (e.g.
 CARQ) from adeck files.
 Both adeck and bdeck data should be provided using the 
\series bold
-track
\series medium
 option.
 The 
\series bold
-track
\series medium
 option must be used at least once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
3.

Optional arguments for tc_gen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
4.
 The 
\series bold
-out base 
\series medium
argument indicates the path of the output file base.
 This argument overrides the default output file base (./tc_gen)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
5.
 The 
\series bold
-log file
\series default
 option directs output and errors to the specified log file.
 All messages will be written to that file as well as standard out and error.
 Thus, users can save the messages without having to redirect the output
 on the command line.
 The default behavior is no log file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
6.
 The 
\series bold
-v level
\series default
 option indicates the desired level of verbosity.
 The contents of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

level
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will override the default setting of 2.
 Setting the verbosity to 0 will make the tool run with no log messages,
 while increasing the verbosity above 1 will increase the amount of logging.

The TC-Gen tool implements the following logic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series medium
Parse the genesis data and identify forecast genesis events separately for
 each model present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series medium
Parse the BEST and operational track data and identify observed genesis
 events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series medium
Loop over the filters defined in the configuration file and apply the following
 logic for each.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series medium
For each forecast genesis event, search the BEST genesis events for a match
 that is close enough in time and space.
 If not found, search the operational genesis events for a match.
 If a match is found, classify the forecast genesis event as a 
\series bold
hit
\series medium
.
 Otherwise, classify it as a 
\series bold
false alarm
\series medium
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series medium
For each BEST track genesis event, determine the initialization and lead
 times for which the model had an opportunity to forecast that genesis event.

\series default
 Classify as a 
\series bold
miss
\series default
 each model opportunity that was not counted as a hit in the previous step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do not count any correct negatives.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Report the contingency table hits, misses, and false alarms separately for
 each forecast model and configuration file filter.

\begin_layout Standard

\series medium
The

init_freq
\series medium
 variable is an integer specifying the model initialization frequency in
 hours, starting at 00Z.
 The default value of 6 indicates that the model is initialized every day
 at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z.
 The same frequency is applied to all models processed.
 Models initialized at different frequencies should be processed with separate
 calls to tc_gen.
 The initialization frequency is used when defining the model opportunities
 to forecast the BEST track genesis events.

The 
\series bold
genesis_radius
\series medium
 entry defines a search radius, in km, relative to the forecast genesis
 location.
 When searching for a match, only those BEST/operational genesis events
 which occur within this radius will be considered.
 Increasing this search radius should lead to an increase in hits.

TC-Gen produces output in STAT and, optionally, ASCII format.
 The ASCII output duplicates the STAT output but has the data organized
 by line type.
 The output files are created based on the 
\series bold
-out
\series default
 command line argument.
 The default output base name, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

./tc_gen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 writes output files in the current working directory named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
